excerpt: The techniques of deep learning have become the state of the art methodology
  for executing complicated tasks from various domains of computer vision, natural
  language processing, and several other areas. Due to its rapid development and promising
  benchmarks in those fields, researchers started experimenting with this technique
  to perform in the area of, especially in intrusion detection related tasks. Deep
  learning is a subset and a natural extension of classical Machine learning and an
  evolved model of neural networks. This paper contemplates and discusses all the
  methodologies related to the leading edge Deep learning and Neural network models
  purposing to the arena of Intrusion Detection Systems.
