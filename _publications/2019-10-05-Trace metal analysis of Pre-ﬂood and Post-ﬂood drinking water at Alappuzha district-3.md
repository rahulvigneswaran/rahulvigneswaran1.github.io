excerpt: 'Trace metals are essential for human survival; however, careless intake of these nutrients can be injurious to human health or even fatal, when consumed in large quantities. The principal objective of this investigation was to assess the changes in trace metal concentrations in groundwater sources, due to the impact of extreme climatic variations and environmentally unfriendly anthropogenic activities, in Alappuzha District, Kerala. An ancillary objective was to evaluate their repercussions on water delivery systems. The main drinking water sources were analyzed for trace elements such as Copper, Zinc, Manganese and Arsenic. Water distribution networks and their delivery outlets can contribute to unsafe levels in contamination of drinking water. While this study has shown minimal spatiotemporal variability of these trace metals, slight changes from the water delivery processes were noted. This unveils an interesting result that can lead to future policy change in water management.'
