## Tasks
- [x] Study the complex dynamics of an ideal quadrotor
- [x] Explore the idea of data-driven control systems in them.
<br/>

A detailed study of the dynamics of a quadcoptor has been conducted and has been documented in the post "[Insight into the Dynamics and State Space Modelling of a 3-D Quadrotor](https://rahulvigneswaran.github.io/posts/2019/01/Insight%20into%20the%20Dynamics%20and%20State%20Space%20Modelling%20of%20a%203-D%20Quadrotor-3/)".
