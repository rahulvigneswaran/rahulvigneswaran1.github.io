## Tasks
- [x]  Leverage the relation between Chebyshev polynomial of the Ô¨Årst kind and approximation theory to develop a data-driven solver for nonlinearly elastic materials.  
- [x] Benchmark the results with several state-of-the-art approaches which include Kernal Regression, Nonlinear Programming (NLP) approach, Mixed-Integer programming (MIP) approach.
