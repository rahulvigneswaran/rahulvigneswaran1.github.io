## Tasks
- [x] Implement and analyze Deep and Shallow Neural Nets in the Cybersecurity use case of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). 
- [x] Analyze and study various state-of-art implementations of Host and Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
<br/>

This project consists of two phases - an Evaluation of Shallow and Deep Neural Networks for Network Intrusion Detection Systems in Cyber Security and a survey on on Network and Host based Intrusion Detection Systems.
