Work experience
======
* Centre for Computational Engineering & Networking (CEN) : Research Intern
  * Explored applications of Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) like de-blurring, super resolution, sound to image translation and pix2pix architecture.
  * Explored Reinforcement Learning algorithms and several Deep learning techniques.
  * Worked on data-driven solvers, control systems, model order reduction techniques and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD).
  * Advisors : [Dr Soman KP](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=R_zpXOkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} & [Dr Gopalakrishnan EA](https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/ea-gopalakrishnan){:target="_blank"}


* Amrita Center for Cyber Security Systems & Networks : Research Intern
  * Worked on devices which harness the abilities of Raman Spectroscopy. Built an electronic stethoscope with inbuilt PCG and ECG. 
  * Design lead for several projects like AmritaMitram - a smartwatch primarily aimed at Women and Child safety, a device which aids patients with hand tremors, a new-age TB Breathalyzer, a Fingerprint scanner and Vehicle tracking device which is adapted to the Indian environment.
  * Advisor : [Dr Prabharan Poornachandran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e233m6MAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}

* Mechatronics & Intelligent Systems Research (MISR) Lab : Research Intern
  * Design lead for making a humanoid robot named AMI (Amrita Mechatronic Intelligence). 
  * Used 3D Printing as the primary method of prototyping. The aﬀordable humanoid was aimed at accumulating interest in Robotics among the students of rural India.
  * Advisors : [Dr Pramod Sreedharan](https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/pramods){:target="_blank"} & [Dr Ganesha Udupa](https://www.amrita.edu/faculty/ganesh){:target="_blank"}

* Ammachi labs : Research Intern
  * Designed a bed-wheelchair transfer system for mobility-impaired patients integrated into the wheelchair at a low cost. 
  * Used SolidWorks as a primary tool for design and assembly and conducted a survey on types of mobility impairment diseases and ways it aﬀects normal human life.
  * Advisors : [Mr Vishnu Rajendran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tj3TFQ4AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} & [Mr Akshay Nagarajan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=7PLJ4A8AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}
