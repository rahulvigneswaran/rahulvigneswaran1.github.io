I am a research intern at [CEN - India](https://www.amrita.edu/center/computational-engineering-and-networking){:target="_blank"} mentored by [Dr Soman KP](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=R_zpXOkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}. I seek to solve theoretical machine learning problems using ideas from optimization and statistics.
